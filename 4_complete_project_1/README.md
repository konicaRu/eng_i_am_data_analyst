## Project research of sales of computer games for 1992-2016. To plan their future sales
__________________________
We analyze the sales of the online store of computer games and games for consoles over the past years. We identify the regularities that determine the success of the game. The report indicated promising genres and platforms for computer games for the upcoming season. The report was sent to the marketing department. As a result, it is planned to increase sales of games by 15% compared to last year.
