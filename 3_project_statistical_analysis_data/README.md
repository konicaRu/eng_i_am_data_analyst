## Prospective tariff definition project for a telecom company
_________________
Analyzed the rates of the mobile operator.  Tested hypotheses about the difference in revenues of subscribers of different tariffs and the difference in revenues of subscribers from Moscow and other regions. Based on customer behavior and spending, a report was generated for the company's development department, which of the tariffs is better. Decisions have been made to increase the company's revenue.
