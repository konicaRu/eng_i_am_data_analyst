## Description of my projects. 
**â„–** |**Description of the project** |**Skills and tools**
:-----------:|----------|------------------------  
1|[**Research of the real estate market in St. Petersburg**](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/konicaRu/i_am_data_analyst/blob/master/2_project_research_data_analysis/2_project_flat_for_sale.ipynb).<br>Investigated and established parameters that, to one degree or another, affect the final cost of an apartment. The data is needed to build an automated apartment appraisal system. <br>***The main factors affecting the price: location, proximity to the center and metro.***| `Python`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `exploratory data analysis`, `data visualization`, `data preprocessing`.
2|[**Research for a telecom company, determination of a promising tariff**](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/konicaRu/data_analyst/blob/master/3_project_statistical_analysis_data/3_project_telecom_tariff.ipynb)<br>Analyzed the tariffs of the mobile operator and customer behavior. Prepared a report for the marketing department - how the rates can be improved.<br>***Recommendations were given: to include more free minutes and Internet traffic in the company's tariffs. And strengthen the expansion of the regions*** |`Python`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `NumPy`, `SciPy`, `descriptive statistics`, `statistical hypothesis testing`
3|[**Project research of sales of computer games in the period from 1992-2016**](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/konicaRu/i_am_data_analyst/blob/master/4_complete_project_1/complete_project_1_computer%20games.ipynb)<br> Investigated the sales of an online store of computer games and games for consoles, in order to place a bet on a potentially popular product, plan advertising campaigns and purchase games.<br>***It is recommended that you pay attention to mobile games and, if possible, invest in your own development.***|`Python`, `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, `data preprocessing`,`exploratory data analysis`, `descriptive statistics`, `statistical hypothesis testing`
4|[**Optimization of marketing costs in Yandex.Afish**](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/konicaRu/i_am_data_analyst/blob/master/6_project_analytics_in_yandex_afisha_3send/6_project%20_analytics_in_yandex_afisha_3send.ipynb)<br>Studied how people use the product, when they start buying, how much money each customer brings, when it pays off.<br>***I found out what is needed to improve conversion: redo the mobile application and pay attention to the display of the site on mobile devices***|`Python`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `cohort analysis`, `unit economy`, `product metrics`
5|[**Testing hypotheses for increasing revenue in an online store - evaluating the results of an A / B test**](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/konicaRu/i_am_data_analyst/blob/master/7_project_a_b_test_2_send/7_project%20_a_b_test_2_send.ipynb)<br>To draw up a plan to increase revenue. Prioritized hypotheses based on ICE and RICE frameworks. I also analyzed the results of the A / B test, built graphs of cumulative revenue, average check, conversion by group.<br>***According to the analysis, it was decided to stop AV testing. The change did not result in a statistically significant difference***|`Python`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `SciPy`, `A / B testing`, `statistical hypothesis testing`
6|[**Research of the public catering market in Moscow for making a decision to open a new robotic cafe.**](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/konicaRu/i_am_data_analyst/blob/master/8_project_public_catering_msk/8_project%20_public_catering_1send.ipynb)<br>The question was investigated - whether a cafe in which guests are served by robotic waiters will be successful and popular in Moscow. Analyzed the market of catering establishments in Moscow.<br>***We found out that the format of the establishment is promising for presentation to investors.***<br> [Cafe presentation for investors](https://github.com/konicaRu/i_am_data_analyst/blob/master/8_project_public_catering_msk/8_project_present_cafe_robot.pdf)|`Pandas` `Plotly` `Python` `Seaborn` `data visualization`.
7|[**Analysis of user behavior in a mobile application.**](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/konicaRu/i_am_data_analyst/blob/master/9_project_ab_test/9_together_in_git_ab_test.ipynb)<br>Analyzed the sales funnel in a food startup and evaluated the results of A / A / B testing. Conclusions are made based on data from a mobile application<br>***We found out: conversion in payment is 47%, excellent result. Changing the font in the application did not bring a statistically significant change in conversion***|`A / B testing` `Matplotlib` `Pandas` `Plotly` `Python` `Seaborn` `data visualization`, `statistical hypothesis testing`, `product metrics`, `event analytics`.
8|[**Created a dashboard for custom events for Yandex Zen managers.**](https://public.tableau.com/profile/dim6669#!/vizhome/10_project_ya_practik/Dashboard1)<br>**We can see:** <br>-How many user interactions with article cards occur in the system, broken down by card topics.<br>-How many cards are generated by sources with different article topics.<br>-How card themes and source themes relate.<br>All charts and tables can be sorted:<br>- by time<br> - by card topics<br> - by age users<br>[**Dashboard presentation**](https://github.com/konicaRu/i_am_data_analyst/blob/master/10_project%20_dashboard/DASHBOARD_dzen.pdf)|`PostgreSQL` `Python` `SQLAlchemy` `Tableau dash` `building dashboards` `product metrics`
9|[**Using machine learning, outlined a strategy to combat the churn of visitors from the network of fitness clubs.**](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/konicaRu/i_am_data_analyst/blob/master/11_project_ML_fitness_club/11_ML_project_1_send.ipynb)<br>Based on the data on visitors to the fitness center chain, I made a forecast of the likelihood of customer churn. Created customer portraits using clustering<br>***We found out: the most loyal clients are over 30 years old, live nearby, go to group classes. To avoid churn, it is necessary to increase their number and loyalty.***|`Matplotlib` `Pandas` `Python``Scikit-learn` `Seaborn` `classification` `clustering` `machine learning`.
